## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `dist/main.js`

### Requirements

## Normal Mode
1. Declare a variable `cars` that is an array of four or more car makes.

4. Use a for loop to iterate over the `cars` array and display only cars that start with the letter 'H' or 'h'.
5. Use a while loop to iterate over the `cars` array and remove a car from the array until there are no cars left in the array.
6. Declare a variable `siblings` that is an array with the following names:

	* `Josh`
	* `Jamie`
	* `Jason`
	* `Jackie`

7. Add the string `Jack` to the beginning of the `siblings` array.
